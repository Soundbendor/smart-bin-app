# The binsight.ai App :herb:

# About/Overview
A cross-platform mobile app built with Flutter/Dart for users of [Soundbendor Lab's](https://www.soundbendor.org) Smart Compost Bin. The app enables Wi-Fi connectivity for the bin, so participants in a field study will be able to use their bin to track household food waste and follow data trends over time.

## Purpose

In the face of an escalating climate crisis, finding more effective food waste disposal methods remains a pressing challenge in the field of sustainability research. To contribute valuable data to efforts in this field, the binsight.ai team pioneers one approach that is aimed at expanding our understanding of food and organic waste at the household and consumer level.

Our project supports a countertop Smart Compost Bin equipped with sensors that capture images of food waste and many associated data points. These include bin internal temperature and humidity, IAQ, CO2, the weight of composted food items, thermal imaging depth maps, and VOCs.

Users of the app will be presented with a fun and engaging User Interface which will allow them to quickly learn and begin using the SoundBendor Smart Compost Bin. After setting up the bin with Wi-Fi, any items the user composts will be sent to their app, enabling them to begin annotating images and thus contributing to the larger dataset.
